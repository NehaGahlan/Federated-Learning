Highlights:

- AFLEMP for Automated Emotion Recognition using Multi-Modal Physiological Signals: EEG, ECG and GSR.
- Federated Learning for preserving sensitive physiological data during emotion recognition.
- Addressing variation heterogeneity (VH) and imbalanced data heterogeneity (IDH) in FL environment.
- Melds different Attention Mechanisms, Transformer with Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
